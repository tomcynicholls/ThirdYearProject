\title{The RSA Encyption Algorithm}
\author{Tom Nicholls}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

Published in 1978, the Rivest-Shamir-Aldeman (RSA) scheme is one of the most widely accepted and implemented approaches to public-key encryption. The RSA algorithm is based upon the difficulty of factoring large integers. It acts as a block cipher in which for some n, the ciphertext and plaintext are integers between 0 and n. Typically, n is less than 1024 bits or 309 decimal digits. Hence, n is less than 2^{1024}.
