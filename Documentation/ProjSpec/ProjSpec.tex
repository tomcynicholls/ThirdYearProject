\section{Problem}

The privacy of sensitive information has always been an important issue. With the development of computer networks and the internet, the secrecy of data is ensured through the use of different techniques of cryptography. Cryptanalysis uses mathematical techniques to ‘break’ the cryptographic methods used. Both cryptography and cryptanalysis are ever increasing and developing fields of computer science and mathematics, both within research and in industry. 

In this project I will research the various techniques used in the current state of cryptography and cryptanalysis. Using this research I will analyse, compare and implement some existing encryption methods, which can be complemented by the development of a new original method, if my analysis shows the need and means for it. I will also develop a unique form of cryptanalysis in an attempt to break the encryption.
