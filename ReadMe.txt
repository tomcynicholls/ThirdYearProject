Tom Nicholls - 1006007 - Software Notes

To view the source code of this project, load the source files from the 'Java Code' folder into either a text editor or an IDE such as Eclipse. 

In order to run the client/server software, the full installation of MySQL and the MySQL workbench is required, which can easily be downloaded from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/.
(Adding the Java connector to the build path as per the website instructions) 
The database can then be loaded and opened through the workbench by 'importing' the file in the 'Database' folder.
Finally, simply compile and run the server and then the client classes, ensuring that the socket specified is open (see source code)

To install and run the application, either:
	 - install the relevant (device specific) drivers, connect the smartphone and 'run' the application
	 - or copy the App.apk file from "JavaCode/App/bin" to the device memory, ensuring that the installing of developed applications option is checked (in the phones settings menu) and run the application straight from the phone.

Note:

	An example of files before and after encryption (as described in the report) can be found in the 'Encryption Example' folder
	Code explanations can be found throughout in the form of code comments, system print statements and appropriately named methods/variables
